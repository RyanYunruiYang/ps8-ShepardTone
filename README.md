# ps8 ShepardTone

RingBuffer and Guitar Strings are both objects. You could play around and play any note in GuitarHero.java, and you can hear the Shepard tone in GuitarHeroShepardTone.java.

The shepard tone is an auditory illusion that happens when you have three scales all separated by an octave. It sounds like there is an infinitely increasing scale.
